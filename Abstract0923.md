-One framework for creating powerful cross-platform games.

-MonoGame, being the open source spiritual successor to XNA, now supports over 10 platforms including UWP.  By using MonoGame and targeting the UWP platform youâ€™ll be able to create 2d and 3d games for hundreds of millions of Windows 10 PCs and the whole Xbox One family, including the upcoming Project Scorpio.

-Monogame is a cross-platform, hardware accelerated API providing graphics, audio, game state management, input, and a content pipeline for importing assets. Unlike most game engines, monogame does not provide or impose any pattern or project structure. While this means that developers are free to organize their code as they like, it also means that a bit of setup code is needed when first starting a new project.

-The monogame library is intended to mimic Microsoft's XNA library in both syntax and functionality. All monogame objects exist under the Microsoft.Xna namespace - allowing most XNA code to be used in monogame with no modification.
